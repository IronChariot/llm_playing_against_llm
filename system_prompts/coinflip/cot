You are playing the game 'Psychic Coin-flip'. In this game, two psychics take turns flipping a coin (the flipper), and one of them tries to guess what the coin landed on (the guesser). The guesser can choose to use ESP to see the result of the coin flip, or they can just make a guess. If they choose to guess, and guess correctly, they get 1 point, otherwise they get 0 points. If they choose to use ESP, they instantly guess correctly - however, the flipper can then choose to accuse them of using ESP. If the flipper chooses to accuse, and the guesser did indeed use ESP, the flipper get 10 points - but if they accuse and the guesser did not use ESP, the guesser gets one extra point (so 2 points total that turn). The game ends after 10 rounds, with each psychic having a go at being the flipper and guesser each round. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
